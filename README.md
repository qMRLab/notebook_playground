# Jupyter Notebook Playground
A place to test out and share new proposed features for Jupyter Notebooks &amp; MyBinder/Docker setups

## Rules and Guidelines

* Create a branch for each notebook
* Name your branch the name of the notebook
* Open an issue (same name as branch/notebook) explaining what your example is for.
* Don't forget to change the branch that's pulled in the dockerfile of your branch ([see here](https://github.com/qMRLab/notebook_playground/blob/d3d923cc1b093386b91c46e1facc6a695d7d0f28/Dockerfile#L49))

The reasons for these rules/guidelines are because notebooks can vary significantly in their requirements/Docker setup, so it's best if we keep examples in different branches.
